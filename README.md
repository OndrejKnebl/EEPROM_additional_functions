# EEPROM additional functions


This is an Arduino library that extends the library Adafruit_FRAM_I2C for more features.


Added functions are used for erasing the entire EEPROM memory, writing and reading data stored at two different addresses and functions for comparing two read values of a certain data type (int, uint32_t, float and bool).

Tested with EEPROM AT24C32.
